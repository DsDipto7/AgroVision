# 🥔 AI Powered Potato Plant Disease Classifier And Solution Giver

A web-based AI system that allows users to **upload images of potato leaves** and instantly predicts whether the leaf is **Healthy**, has **Early Blight**, or **Late Blight** using Deep Learning.  
Users can also **chat with an AI assistant** (powered by Gemini API) to get treatment solutions and suggestions in **Bengali** or English.

## ✅ Conclusion

This project was developed as part of a learning journey in AI and web development. It showcases the power of deep learning in real-world applications like crop disease detection. By integrating a CNN model with a chatbot powered by Gemini API, the system not only detects diseases but also provides helpful solutions in the user's native language.

In the future, I plan to extend this project to support more crops, multi-language support, and cloud-based deployment.
